# Ricci flow - Sample graphs

This repository includes sample graphs that are commonly used in academia with precomputed Ricci curvature and Ricci flows using [GraphRicciCurvature](https://github.com/saibalmars/GraphRicciCurvature) package. The graphs are stored in [gexf](https://gephi.org/gexf/format/) format, you can easily read it with [networkx](https://networkx.github.io) or open it with graph visualizer [Gephi](https://gephi.org).

## Sample graphs

All graphs are computed with setting `method=Sinkhorn`,`base=e`, `power=2`, `iter=20 (or 50)`.
